# Flee Visualization
Based and built upon 
[Flee - the agent based modelling toolkit](https://github.com/djgroen/flee-release "Flee release link").
The simulated data from the flee system is exported into a json format and then
used to built several different visualizations using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
